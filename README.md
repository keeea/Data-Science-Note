# Inferential Statistics
## CLT and Sampling

### Standard Error
- Population standard deviation: σ
- Sample standard deviation: s
- Know σ:

- Don't know σ:

### SD (σ or s) and SE（standard error): 
SE **ONLY** represent variability in **point estimates** from different samples of the same size and from the same population.

### SE over Sample Size
As sample size n increase, sampling variability / SE is expected to decrease.

### Sample Distribution VS Sampling Distribution 
Every observatioon in the **sample distribution** is a **randomly sampled unit**, while every observation in **sampling distribution** is a **sample statistic**.

### Central Limit Theorem (CLT): 
The **distribution of sample statistics** is **nearly normal**, **centered** at the population mean, and with a **standard deviation** equal to the population standard deviation divided by square root of the sample size.

### Conditions for the CLT
1. **Independence**: Sampled observations must be independent.
- random sample/assignment
- if sampling without replacement, n < 10% of population
2. **Sample size/skew**: 
Either the population distribution is normal, or if the population distribution is skewed, the sample size is large (rule of thumb: n > 30).

### Application of CLT
1. In most case, CLT will not be directly applied to the individual observations, but mean or sum/size. 
2. And if the population distribution isn't normal, you could not apply Z-score to calculate probability.
